## UI/UX Patterns

### Page structure

All pages in `app[locale]/**/page.tsx` and their components should follow these guidelines strictly.

The first element on all pages is the `PageWrapper` which sets primary padding.
Next should be a layout component [Main layout components](#main-layout-components) which sets spacing and alignment and gaps.
Contents should be placed in the layout components.

### Page styles and spacing

All styles, colors, fonts and paddings, margins and gaps are set in the existing components. There should not be need to explicitly set any styling when using existing components.

### Main layout components

All pages should use PageWrapper as root component and then use layout components to wrap contents.

Read the documentation show layout components are built from the `app/components/v2/core/block/Block.tsx`.

#### Layout blocks

Layout components use blocks to render their children. Each block has background and content area. Children are rendered only to content area.

There are four types of blocks:

- main: the root level. Used as a direct child of PageWrapper. If it has a background color or image, it covers full width of the page.
- content: Content is placed in this block. It has max width and is centered on wide screens. Sets correct padding to the content.
- box: presents a box which can be any container inside a content block.
- component: used for aligning component elements.

#### Layout components

There are ready-made layouts for different purposes:

- layout/Hero: create hero layout with image, title and contact information. Must have an image
- layout/BasicLayout: Content is rendered in a flex box with direction column by default. Use in simple layout.
- layout/TwoColumnLayout: Renders two children a columns with gaps and spacing. Will render columns vertically in mobile.
- layout/ThreeColumnLayout: Renders three children a columns with gaps and spacing. Will render columns vertically in mobile.
- layout/GridLayout: places children in to Content Block and wraps with an element with display:grid
- layout/FlexLayout: places children in to Content Block and wraps with an element with display:flex
- layout:BoxLayout: like GridLayout, but content padding is different. Aligns its children (boxes), so they are outside content area but contents of the boxes is aligned like other content.
- layout/CustomMainContent: basic layout for showing content. Uses Main block + Content block. Accepts images and content. Should only be used if other layouts do not work.

#### Layout custom content components

Layouts expect certain child components. They are not compulsory, but help align content for the layout's purpose.
Prefer using them as direct children of the layouts.

### Content components

Placed in @app/components/vs/core

- Card: Content component to render elements in a flex box in the content slot of a layout component.
- Flex: wraps children with flex box with responsive breakpoints when to show children in one column.
- Columns: wraps children with grid with responsive breakpoints to change column counts.
- BackgroundImage: Renders an image to div with inset and position absolute. Accepts responsive backgroundSize and backgroundPosition.
- PageWrapper: Root wrapper for all pages

### Colors and palettes

Each layout has two palettes:

- palette: used by the main block and visually covers the whole block. Use only to set background color of the full page width element. Default is white background with black text, borders, icons and buttons. Palette name is "default"
- contentPalette: used by the content block and is used by its children. If not set, the palette is inherited from main block. No default.

### UI components

- Accordion: basic accordion component
- Headings: different Heading sizes (h1...h6) with size variants. Uses palette colors.
- ImageContainer: wrapper to images to handle aspect ratio and padding.
- LinkButton: renders a link looking like a button
- List: renders <ul>
- Paragraph: renders <p> with size variations

### Core components that should not be used outside blocks

**Do not use these because they must be nested properly in a blocks**

- Block: core component to render block + content
- ContentArea: render div.content-area

## Component usage

First add a PageWrapper to page

The use layouts:

```typescript
<FlexLayout>{children}</FlexLayout>
```

---

#### Palettes

There are ready made palettes used by components:

- "betoni": with background color: #6D6E71 and accessible text and button and icon colors.
- "kupari" with background color: #C49A6C and accessible text and button and icon colors.
- "piki" with background color: #231F20 and accessible text and button and icon colors.
- "light-gray" with background color: #f6f6f6 and accessible text and button and icon colors.
- "black" with background color: #000000 and accessible text and button and icon colors.
- "beige" with background color: #E8E4DA and accessible text and button and icon colors.
- "maantie" with background color: #D9D9D9 and accessible text and button and icon colors.
- "default" with background color: #ffffff and accessible text and button and icon colors.

Use palettes in the components and not apply other colors with className.

Palettes are used with palette prop:

```typescript
<Content palette="piki"></Content>
```

Child components will use colors from palette, so there is no need to apply colors with classNames.

#### Colors

These are brand colors, but do not use them in components. Use palette prop or no colors at all.

- Colors:

  - Primary Colors:
    - Kupari (Copper): #C49A6C
    - Piki (Pitch Black): #231F20
    - SÃ¤hkÃ¶ (Electric Blue): #4441E8
  - Neutral Colors:
    - Beige: #E8E4DA
    - Maantie (Road Grey): #D9D9D9
    - Betoni (Concrete): #6D6E71
    - White: #FFFFFF
  - Semantic Colors:
    - Success: #16A75C
    - Warning: #F59E0B
    - Error: #EF4444
    - Info: #3A8DDE
  - Dark Mode:
    - Background: #1E293B
    - Card Background: #0F172A
    - Text: #F5F7FA

#### Typography

Use components that have typography already set. They can be imported from folder `@/app/components/v2/core/`.

- Heading1, Heading2,Heading3
- Paragraph,
- Button
- LinkButton
- List

- Typography:

  - Primary Font: Inter Tight
  - Available Weights: Light, Regular, Bold, Black
  - Headings: Inter Tight
  - Body: Inter Tight
  - Monospace: Inter Tight

- Heading Styles:

  Prefer using `Heading` components which have all necessary variations, colors and fonts built-in.

  - Main Headings (H1):

    - Font: Inter Tight
    - Size: text-4xl (2.25rem) on mobile, text-5xl (3rem) on desktop
    - Weight: font-bold
    - Color: Innolease Blue (#0E4C92)
    - Line Height: leading-tight (1.25)
    - Margin Bottom: mb-6

  - Section Headings (H2):

    - Font: Inter Tight
    - Size: text-3xl (1.875rem)
    - Weight: font-semibold
    - Color: Innolease Blue (#0E4C92)
    - Line Height: leading-tight (1.25)
    - Margin Bottom: mb-4

  - Content Headings (H3):
    - Font: Inter Tight
    - Size: text-2xl (1.5rem)
    - Weight: font-medium
    - Color: Innolease Dark Blue (#072B54)
    - Line Height: leading-normal (1.5)
    - Margin Bottom: mb-3

#### Components

Prefer using ready made components and do not create new ones.

Components in app structure:

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ components
|   |â”€â”€ v2
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ blocks      # Wrapper to use nested core/block.tsx components
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ component   # Custom components for special cases like news.
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ core        # core components that other components use
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ layouts     # ready made layout components for aligning and wrapping actual content. **Prefer using these in all pages**!
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ styling      # css and styling helpers
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ utils        # utils for components

```

Read each components documentation in JSDOc format in their \*.tsx files.

#### Pages

All pages must have <PageWrapper> as the root component.

Then each page must use layout/ components to wrap actual components. Block components are located in folder "@/app/components/v2/blocks"

#### Colors

Block components use palette-prop to define colors. Use the prop, do not assign other colors. See [Palettes](#palettes)

### Spacing and alignment

Components set spacing, padding, gaps, and alignment, automatically. Do not set them with classNames.

### Creating new visuals, components and charts

Always prefer using existing components. See [Components](#components).

When creating new components, use these guidelines:

- Forms:

  - Input fields: Light background, dark border, focus state with blue outline
  - Dropdowns: Custom styled with chevron icon
  - Checkboxes: Custom styled with blue check
  - Radio buttons: Custom styled with blue dot
  - Toggle switches: Blue when active, gray when inactive
  - Form validation: Inline error messages in red
  - Form sections: Logical grouping with clear section headers

- Data Visualization:
  - Cost charts: Bar and line charts
  - Fleet composition: Pie and donut charts
  - Timeline charts: For contract and maintenance tracking
  - Vehicle status indicators: Color-coded status badges
  - Emissions dashboard: Environmental impact visualization
  - Cost comparisons: Side-by-side bar charts

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  - sm: 640px
  - md: 768px
  - lg: 1024px
  - xl: 1280px
  - 2xl: 1536px

### Animations

- Subtle hover effects on interactive elements
- Loading states with minimal animations
- Page transitions for a smooth experience
- Micro-interactions for feedback
- Chart animations for data presentation

### Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode
- Focus indicators
- Accessible form labels
- Alternative text for images
- Semantic HTML structure

## Styling Approach

1. Colors are fixed in [Palettes](#palettes) and they are used by passing `palette`-props to block components.

2. Tailwind CSS

   - Custom configuration for Innolease brand colors
   - Consistent spacing and sizing
   - Component-specific utilities
   - Responsive utility classes
   - Dark mode support

3. CSS Modules

   - For complex components
   - Animation keyframes
   - Custom properties
   - Vehicle display modules
   - Fleet dashboard components

4. Layouts
   Use existing components for new layouts, wrappers and containers.

5. Reusable Components
   Use existing [Components](#components) and their variations.

6. New components
   New components should use palettes and not set colors or fonts with classNames.
   There are no components for:
   - Form elements
   - Card designs
   - Table components
   - Modal dialogs
   - Vehicle cards

### Graphical Patterns and Overlays

- **Patterns:** The brand utilizes distinct graphical elements derived from the logo:

  - A single, curved parallelogram shape.
  - A wavy pattern formed by repeating and mirroring this shape.
  - A tiled pattern using variations of the shape.
  - These are typically rendered in neutral colors like 'Road Grey' or 'Concrete Grey'.

- **Usage:** These patterns can be used subtly as background overlays on containers, images, or sections (e.g., hero sections, feature cards) to reinforce brand identity without overwhelming the content.

- **Implementation (CSS Overlay):**

  - **Method:** Use CSS pseudo-elements (`::before` or `::after`) on the container element.
  - **Styling:** Apply the pattern using `background-image` (preferably an SVG for scalability and sharpness) or potentially CSS gradients/masks for simpler patterns. Set `background-repeat`, `background-size`, and `background-position` as needed.
  - **Subtlety:** Control visibility using the `opacity` property (e.g., `opacity: 0.05` or `opacity: 0.1`).
  - **Interaction:** Ensure the overlay doesn't interfere with user interaction by setting `pointer-events: none;`.
  - **Layering:** Use `position: absolute`, `inset: 0`, and potentially `z-index` to position the overlay correctly behind content.
  - **Blending:** Consider `background-blend-mode` (e.g., `multiply`, `overlay`) for interesting effects when layered over images or colors.
  - **Centralization:** Store SVG patterns or common CSS overlay utility classes centrally for consistency.

- **Conceptual Example (Pattern Overlay):**

  ```css
  .container-with-pattern-overlay {
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .container-with-pattern-overlay::after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0; /* Cover entire container */
    background-image: url("/path/to/innolease-pattern.svg");
    background-repeat: repeat;
    background-size: 60px 60px; /* Example size */
    opacity: 0.08; /* Adjust for subtlety */
    pointer-events: none;
    z-index: 0; /* Behind content if needed */
  }
  ```

- **Example (Text Overlay):** As seen in some card examples, a simple semi-transparent overlay can be used behind text sections placed over images to ensure readability. This typically uses `background-color` with an alpha value (e.g., `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`) on a pseudo-element covering the text area.

## Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages using next-intl with a modular namespace-based approach:

### Locale File Structure

```
messages/
â”œâ”€â”€ en/                  # English translations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Index.json       # Homepage-related translations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.json      # Footer-related translations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Blog.json        # Blog-related translations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...              # Other feature namespaces
â”œâ”€â”€ fi/                  # Finnish translations (same namespace structure)
â”œâ”€â”€ sv/                  # Swedish translations (same namespace structure)
â”œâ”€â”€ backup/              # Backup of original monolithic files
â”œâ”€â”€ localization-report.md  # Report on namespace coverage across locales
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Documentation about the localization structure
```

### Using Translations

Translations are organized by namespace, making it easier to:

- Locate translations for specific features
- Compare translations across languages
- Maintain consistency within logical sections

### Translation Workflow

1. Identify the appropriate namespace for the UI element
2. Add the key to the corresponding namespace file in all supported locales
3. Use namespaced keys in components: `t('Namespace.section.key')`
4. Run `npm run check-translations` periodically to ensure completeness

### Translation Management Scripts

- `npm run split-locales`: Splits monolithic locale files into namespace-based files
- `npm run check-translations`: Validates translation completeness across locales
- `npm run import-translations:local/prod`: Imports translations from external sources

### Navigation Implementation

For implementing the navigation and footer, we'll use the following approach:

1. **Main Navigation Component**

   - Create a reusable `MainNavigation` component
   - Implement dropdown functionality with React state management
   - Use CSS transitions for smooth interactions
   - Handle responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints

2. **Footer Component**

   - Create a reusable `Footer` component
   - Implement responsive grid layout
   - Ensure all links are accessible
   - Optimize for mobile viewing

3. **Common Features**
   - All navigation links to use Next.js `Link` component for client-side navigation
   - Internationalization support for all menu items
   - SEO-friendly markup structure
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - ARIA attributes for accessibility

This navigation structure ensures all important pages are easily accessible while maintaining a clean, uncluttered interface. The dropdown menus organize content logically without overwhelming users with too many top-level options.
