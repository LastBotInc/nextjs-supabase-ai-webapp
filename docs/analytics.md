# Advanced Analytics Dashboard - Planning Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for extending our current analytics system into an advanced, Google Analytics 4-like dashboard. Our goal is to transform basic page view tracking into a sophisticated analytics platform that provides actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Data Collection
Our current analytics system collects the following data:

**Analytics Sessions:**
- Session ID (UUID)
- First page visited
- User ID (if authenticated)
- User agent and device type
- Referrer information
- Geographic data (country, city)
- Session timestamps (created, updated, last_seen)

**Analytics Events:**
- Event type (currently only 'page_view')
- Page URL and locale
- Session and user associations
- Device and geographic context
- Metadata (JSONB for extensibility)

**Current Limitations:**
- Only tracks page views
- No funnel analysis
- No user journey mapping
- No engagement metrics beyond session duration
- No conversion tracking
- No real-time analytics
- No cohort analysis
- No advanced segmentation

## Advanced Analytics Vision

### Core Principles
1. **User-Centric Approach**: Focus on user journeys rather than just page views
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Track all interactions as events
3. **Real-Time Insights**: Provide immediate feedback on user behavior
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Use AI to forecast trends and user behavior
5. **Privacy-First**: Respect user privacy while providing valuable insights
