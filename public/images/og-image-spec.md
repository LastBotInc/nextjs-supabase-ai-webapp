- **File Size:** Aim for under 300KB.
- **Branding:** Include the Innolease logo subtly where appropriate (e.g., corner placement).
- **Text:** Keep text minimal and highly readable. Use the brand font (Specify font if known). Text should summarize the page content concisely.

## Design Considerations

- Maintain brand consistency across all images.
- Use a white/light or brand-blue background generally.
- The Innolease logo should be clear but not dominant.
