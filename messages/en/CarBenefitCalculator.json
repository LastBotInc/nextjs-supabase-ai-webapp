      "question2": "How accurate are the calculations?",
      "answer2": "The calculator uses current Finnish tax regulations and standard cost estimates. While it provides a good approximation, actual costs may vary based on specific circumstances. For precise financial planning, consult our leasing experts.",
      "question3": "Can I use this calculator for electric vehicles?",
      "answer3": "Yes, the calculator takes into account the special tax benefits for electric vehicles in Finland. When calculating with electric vehicles, adjust the fuel consumption to represent electricity costs per km.",
      "question4": "How often are the tax values updated?",
      "answer4": "We update our calculator whenever the Finnish Tax Administration releases new car benefit values, typically annually. The current calculator reflects the 2023-2024 values."
